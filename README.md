Chef Cookbook to install WP for the DevOps BCN workshop

## Requirements

In order to follow the workshop in this repository, you should have installed the following:

* [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org)
* [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com)
* [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) 2.1.2 or newer

If you have [RVM](http://rvm.io), you will need to have Ruby 2.1.2 installed and it will create the gemset automagically.
Once the Ruby stack is installed, you should run `bundle install` within the repository directory.
